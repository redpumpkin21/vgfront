# Find a Game

Find a Game is a project I created with simple learning and keep skills goals;React,  React Player, Search functionaionality, and Python for my back end.  



### `Technologies`

    React Router v6:
         With react router recently updating to v6, it switched ways to do roytes. Mainly, No more <Switch> and Routes being more simple to write. It was a great learning exerience to have that I struggled at first, but learned fairly quickly how to. 

    ReactPlayer:
        This was the most frustrating to use. AS there appears to be some challenges with using Reactplayer and Display:Flex on it's parent componet and align items center. As no matter what the width will auto shrink. which, I learned is solved with a simple align-items: stretch pn the player-wrapper. 
    

### `functionality`

It's pretty simple at the moment. Just click on te game to see the game content. You can use the seach bar to look up titles of a game. 

Future builds will have more games to have a functionality for genre of game.
